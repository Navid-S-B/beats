This project aims to create a music compiler in c using a linux shell as the UI.

You can create a track by adding notes and octaves in many track configurations up 
according to the spec.

This project was intended for myself to learn how to utilise linked lists, simple memory management,
understand header files and their integration into c projects, create simple test code
to debug the main code.

## TO NOTE
This code was developed successfully up to Subset 4, according to the assignment spec.
